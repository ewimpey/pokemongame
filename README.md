# pokemongame
A game for kiddos to guess pokemon

Run the pkmn_app.R app to open the RShiny app. Click 'Get New Pokemon' to play. 
Each round has 3 possible points: 
1. Naming the pokemon (spelling counts)
2. Naming the type(s)
3. Identifying the first region where the pokemon appeared

Will need to install the following R libraries: shiny, highcharter, magick


# TODO:
* Test to make sure this actually works
* Clear fields after clicking 'new submission'
* Keep score for multiple games
* Retain leaderboard for best scores
* find the actual pokemon data to pull rather than relying on the `highcharter` repo
